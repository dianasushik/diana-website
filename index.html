         <h1>About Me</h1>
         <p> I am a beginner Software Engineer student. This website was my final prework project. Flatiron has taught me so much already, and I have not even had my first day yet. I am expected to graduate November of 2022. Hopefully, with a richer knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and much more. </p> <!--write about me-->
